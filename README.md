# ForestLabelColorMask

You will need to have a video and ground truth label ready to use this program. 

Import your outdoor video in this way: capture = cv2.VideoCapture("path_to_your_video")
Then get a ground truth csv file from the ExperimentalForest project here: https://github.com/jhn8709/ExperimentalForest

The important files are UsingPolygon.ipynb, IoUTesting.ipynb, and SchemaAnalysis.ipynb
